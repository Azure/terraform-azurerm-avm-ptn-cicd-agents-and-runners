# Azure DevOps with Container Instances, public networking and UAMI authentication

This example deploys Azure DevOps Agents to Azure Container Instances using public networking and User Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI) authentication. Use this pattern when private networking is not required.

## Authentication

This example uses the [`azuredevops`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/microsoft/azuredevops/latest/docs) provider's default Azure CLI authentication. Set the organization URL via the `AZDO_ORG_SERVICE_URL` environment variable and sign in with the Azure CLI before running Terraform:

```bash
export AZDO_ORG_SERVICE_URL="https://dev.azure.com/<your-organization>"
az login
```

For other provider authentication methods (Personal Access Token, OIDC, Managed Identity, Service Principal, etc.), see the [provider authentication documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/microsoft/azuredevops/latest/docs#authentication).
