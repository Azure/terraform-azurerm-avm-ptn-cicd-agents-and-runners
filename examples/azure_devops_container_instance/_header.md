# Azure DevOps minimal example with a container instance and private networking

This example deploys Azure DevOps Agents to Azure Container Instance using the minimal set of required variables using private networking and User Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI) authentication. No Personal Access Token is required for the agents to register with Azure DevOps.

## Authentication

This example uses the [`azuredevops`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/microsoft/azuredevops/latest/docs) provider's default Azure CLI authentication. Set the organization URL via the `AZDO_ORG_SERVICE_URL` environment variable and sign in with the Azure CLI before running Terraform:

```bash
export AZDO_ORG_SERVICE_URL="https://dev.azure.com/<your-organization>"
az login
```

For other authentication methods (Personal Access Token, OIDC, Managed Identity, Service Principal, etc.), see the [provider authentication documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/microsoft/azuredevops/latest/docs#authentication).
