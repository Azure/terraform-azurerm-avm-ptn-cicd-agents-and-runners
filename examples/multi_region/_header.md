# Azure DevOps example with private networking and multi-region

This example deploys Azure DevOps Agents to Azure Container Apps using the minimal set of required variables using private networking and multi-region support.

>NOTE: Multi-region support may result in duplicated agent scaling, there is no built-in mechanism to prevent this.
